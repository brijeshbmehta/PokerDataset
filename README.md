# PokerDataset
Poker Dataset and large synthetic versions of Poker Dataset

Hello,

I have generated large synthetic versions of poker dataset for my reasearch work but due to storage limitation I am not able to upload it on GitHub.
I have uploaded all three versions of dataset at kaggle.
1. Original poker dataset from UCI repository (24MB - 1M records)
2. Poker10M (225MB - 10M records)
3. Poker100M (2.19GB - 100M records)
You may access it by visiting the folowing link.
